# Hashtag retweet bot

A bot that retweets all tweets tagged by a certain hashtag. Ideal for conferences, meetup groups, communities, etc.

As an example, let's say you want to retweet every tweet found with the hashtag #icecream every 5 minutes (300 seconds). This ruby gem will let you do it as easily as running:

    hashtag_retweet_bot icecream 300

## Preresquites

There are several preresquites:

* feedzirra
* twibot( -> twitter4r )
* activerecord
* rtranslate

I copied the following gems lib into the lib directory becouse there was a CONFLICT between different twitter wrappers:

* twibot 0.1.7
 - included standalone version in lib directory
* mbbx6spp-twitter4r (>= 0.3.1)

## Difference between the original source (@balinterdi) and mine

1. rtranslate gem dependency and translateing at lib/bot.rb:52-53
2. lib directory contains twibot 0.1.7 and mbbx6spp-twitter4r

## Installation

    gem install balinterdi-hashtag_retweet_bot --source http://gems.github.com

Create the database:

    mysqladmin create my_conference_db

Create a directory where you will run the bot from, and a config directory with 2 files in it: _database.yml_ for your database settings and _bot.yml_ for the login/password of the twitter account.

    mkdir -p bot_for_my_conference/config
    cd config/bot_for_my_conference
    touch database.yml bot.yml

Put the credentials for the twitter account in _bot.yml_:

    login: my_conference_bot
    password: secret

Put the database connection attributes in _database.yml_:

    adapter: mysql
    username: root
    host: localhost
    password:
    database: my_conference_db

And create the table on the database that will hold the tweets:

    hashtag_retweet_bot create_db_table

## Run it

Now the only thing left to do is running the bot, telling it what tag to follow, like that:

    hashtag_retweet_bot tag_to_follow

This will launch the bot with a default pause of 180 seconds. If you want a different time schedule you can specify other value for the seconds parameter, but I've experienced Twitter connection problems when trying to update every 60 seconds or less:

    hashtag_retweet_bot tag_to_follow seconds_between_updates

Example:

    hashtag_retweet_bot icecream
    hashtag_retweet_bot icecream 240

## Live examples
